# rayTracing

These are two of the course projects for Computer Graphics I&II, where basic idea of illumination/lighting and a simple ray tracing program (and some 3D maths) were implemented.

In the 1st project, the suer was able to switch between Phong and Gauraud shader, as well as between Phong and Blinn-Phong lighting. The user has the choice to turn on and off the head light and point light in space. The user can also adjust the color channel of ambient, diffuse, and specular light, respectively.

In the 2rd project, a simple ray tracing program was implement. Diffrent materials were used in this demo, including a perfect mirror surface and a see-thru glass material. The user has the choice to super-sample or add jitter in the post-processing part. The depths of rays are also adjustable, although the more depths to trace, the slower the program will become!

In both projects, the user can adjust the location of the camera by W/A/S/D and the camera direction by mouse drag.
